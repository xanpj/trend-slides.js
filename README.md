# trend-slides.js

Making presentations in JSON.

If you quickly need to create slides for a trend report or any other image-focussed presentation, it's tedious to it with click and drop.

That's why with trend-slides.js you create you're presentation in JSON!

1. Place you're images in the `img/` folder
2. Edit the `content.js`
3. Open the `index.html`

It will then be displayed as an interactive html presentation. Also, you can edit you're JSON in the same window. For this, use the edit button in the bottom-right, click download and replace your content.js file.

This can also be used for automatic report generation.
